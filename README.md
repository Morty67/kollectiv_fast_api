# FastAPI for User and Tasks with Categories Management
This project is a server-side component of a web application that provides APIs for managing users and tasks and their categories. It uses the FastAPI framework to create API endpoints and stores data in a PostgreSQL database.
## Technologies Used

*  Backend: FastAPI.
*  Database: Async PostgreSQL.
*  ORM:  SQLAlchemy.
*  Docker for containerization.
*  Celery + Redis for tasks
*  JWT for authentication.

## Features:
*  Optimization of image quality in jpec format at the endpoint /images/optimize-image/, the result can be sent to your email. Powered by Celery + Redis
*  Save Tasks: Create or update an Tasks in the database.
*  Save User: Create or update a user in the database.
*  Save Category: Create or update a category in the database.
